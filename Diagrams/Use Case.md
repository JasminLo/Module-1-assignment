Use Case:

Brief: The Observer presses play. The console prints out the expected output for the game.

Casual:

Main Success Scenario:

The Observer presses play and the console prints the expected output for the game.

Alternate Scenarios:

The Observer decides to stop the console while compiling.

The Observer decides to take a look at the code instead of running the program.

The Observer decides to ask questions about the code or the logic behind the code.

Fully Dressed:
